# OpenSCAD Copilot - Development Roadmap

## Project Vision
A modern cross-platform OpenSCAD editor with live preview and AI copilot capabilities, built with Tauri + React. The application treats OpenSCAD as a headless renderer while providing a superior editing experience with real-time feedback and AI-assisted code generation.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Minimal Vertical Slice (COMPLETED)

**Goal:** Establish basic end-to-end workflow with live preview

### Completed Features
- ‚úÖ **Project scaffolding**: Tauri + React monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- ‚úÖ **Monaco editor**: Custom OpenSCAD syntax highlighting (keywords, builtins, comments)
- ‚úÖ **Live preview**: PNG rendering with 300ms debounced updates
- ‚úÖ **Auto-detect OpenSCAD**: Finds binary in PATH or common installation locations
- ‚úÖ **Error diagnostics**: Parse OpenSCAD stderr and display as inline markers
- ‚úÖ **Diagnostics panel**: Clickable error/warning list at bottom
- ‚úÖ **Cache-busted preview**: Timestamp-based image refresh to avoid browser caching

### Technical Architecture

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/shared/           # Zod schemas for type safety
```

### IPC Commands Implemented
- `locate_openscad`: Auto-detect or validate explicit path
- `render_preview`: Generate PNG with `--preview --imgsize=W,H`
- `detect_backend`: Check OpenSCAD version and Manifold support (basic)

### Key Learnings & Fixes
- Fixed `--imgsize` format: OpenSCAD requires comma separator (e.g., `800,600` not `800x600`)
- Added cache-busting query params to force browser image reload
- Used `convertFileSrc` for Tauri asset protocol compatibility

## Design Decisions & Tradeoffs

### Key Architectural Choices
1. **Headless OpenSCAD**: Invoke as CLI subprocess rather than linking as library
   - ‚úÖ Avoids GPL licensing complications
   - ‚úÖ Works with any OpenSCAD installation
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Slower than in-process rendering

2. **PNG-first preview**: Fast raster output while typing, STL for interaction
   - ‚úÖ Instant feedback (< 1s for simple shapes)
   - ‚úÖ No GPU required for basic editing
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Not interactive until STL export

3. **Server-side LLM**: API keys never touch frontend
   - ‚úÖ Secure key storage (OS keychain)
   - ‚úÖ Can add rate limiting/validation
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires network for AI features

4. **Diff-based edits**: LLM returns patches, not full files
   - ‚úÖ Atomic apply/rollback
   - ‚úÖ Smaller token usage
   - ‚úÖ Preserves user code structure

5. **Monorepo with pnpm**: Shared types between frontend/backend
   - ‚úÖ Type safety across IPC boundary
   - ‚úÖ Easy to version/publish shared package
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex build setup

### Performance Targets
- **Preview latency**: < 500ms for simple shapes (cube, sphere)
- **Editor responsiveness**: < 100ms keystroke to screen
- **LLM response**: < 10s for typical code generation
- **Startup time**: < 2s to interactive

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 ‚úÖ
- [x] Can edit OpenSCAD code and see preview
- [x] Errors shown in < 1s of typing
- [x] Works on macOS with Homebrew OpenSCAD

### Phase 2 Goals
- [x] STL viewer loads in < 2s
- [x] Can toggle 3D/2D modes seamlessly
- [x] Cache hit rate > 80% for repeated renders

### Phase 3 Goals
- [ ] LLM generates valid code > 90% of time
- [ ] Diff apply success rate > 95%
- [ ] < 5% rollbacks due to compilation failures

### Phase 4 Goals
- [ ] Zero critical bugs in production
- [ ] App passes macOS Gatekeeper without warnings
- [ ] User can complete full workflow (edit ‚Üí preview ‚Üí export ‚Üí save)

---

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Current Limitations
1. No undo/redo stack yet (Monaco has built-in, but not tracked across renders)
2. No multi-file support (use/include directives won't resolve)
3. Preview resolution fixed at 800x600 (should be configurable)
4. No way to save/load projects (just live editing)
5. OpenSCAD stderr parsing is regex-based (brittle, may miss some errors)

### Future Refactoring
- Consider moving to structured error output if OpenSCAD adds JSON support
- Abstract render backend (could support other CSG tools like CadQuery)
- Add telemetry for performance monitoring (opt-in)
