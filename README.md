## ‚ú® Motivation

As a software engineer and maker hobbyist, I love OpenSCAD. It allows for precision and maps to my mental model of building things. However, some operations (like rounding with `minkowski`) are not very intuitive. At work, I often use Cursor and Claude Code for writing code, and found myself plugging my OpenSCAD code into ChatGPT in order to either (1) scaffold out a starting point or (2) fix a confusing issue in my code. I also became frustrated by certain limitations of the OpenSCAD editor, like not being able to easily indent code with the editor commands I'm used to. Lastly, for 2d graphics (which I often create for laser cutting), the preview experience as a 3D view feels very strange. So I built OpenSCAD Studio, which aims to be something like a Cursor for the language.

## ‚ú® Features

* Built in AI chat that can edit the code and view diagnostics
* First-class 2D graphics support with a separate SVG viewer
* Modern code editor with auto-formatting using Monaco & Tree Sitter

### üé® Editor
- **Monaco Editor** with custom OpenSCAD syntax highlighting
- **Multi-tab editing** with drag-and-drop reordering
- **Auto-save** and unsaved changes tracking
- **Format on save** with configurable indentation
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for common operations

### üñºÔ∏è Preview
- **Live 3D mesh viewer** with orbit controls (Three.js + STL)
- **Fast PNG preview** while typing (< 500ms)
- **2D SVG mode** for 2D designs
- **Auto-detect dimension mode** (2D vs 3D)
- **Content-hash caching** for instant re-renders

### ü§ñ AI Copilot
- **Diff-based editing** with validation and rollback
- **Streaming responses** with real-time tool visualization
- **Security-first** architecture (API keys in OS keychain)
- **Test compilation** before accepting changes
- **Multi-turn conversations** with context preservation

### üöÄ Export & Diagnostics
- **Export to multiple formats**: STL, OBJ, AMF, 3MF, PNG, SVG, DXF
- **Real-time error diagnostics** with inline markers
- **OpenSCAD stderr parsing** with line/column precision
- **Auto-detect OpenSCAD** installation

### Limitations

OpenSCAD Studio is a very new project and still does not support everything that OpenSCAD does. The main ones right now:

* No support for special operators (!, #, etc)
* No customizer support

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

1. The **opescad** cli binary must be installed and available in your PATH. You can install via package manager:
  - macOS: `brew install openscad`
  - Ubuntu: `sudo apt install openscad`
  - Windows: Download installer from website

2. For development, you'll need:
   - **Node.js** 18+ and **pnpm**
     ```bash
     npm install -g pnpm
     ```
   - **Rust** toolchain (for building Tauri backend)
     ```bash
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```

### Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode (with hot reload)
pnpm tauri:dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri:build
```

The built application will be in `apps/ui/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## ü§ñ AI Copilot Setup

The AI copilot uses a secure sidecar architecture with API keys stored in your OS keychain.

1. Open Settings (‚åò,)
2. Navigate to "AI" tab
3. Enter your Anthropic / OpenAI API key
4. Key is securely stored in macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service

**Supported Providers:**
- Anthropic
- OpenAI

The AI can:
- View your current code and preview
- Make targeted code changes with exact string replacement
- Check for compilation errors
- All edits are validated and test-compiled before acceptance
